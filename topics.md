# Topics covered in this work

This work presents  a practical experience on how to make libraries for javascript VMs, focusing on the V8 engine running in clients, like web browsers and server side scripts, like Node.js. 

Under the hands-on experience, some theory and philosophies are presented, pointing more literature and links to resources, allowing the student to dive deeply in the mater, if needed. It covers the basics of Hardware and SO's architecture, application virtual machines, like V8 and Rhino, just-in-time compilation, like TurboFan and JVM, parser, like Ignition (V8) and OPCache (PHP), notions of opcodes, bytecodes. The study presents examples made with raw javascript, typescript, torque, C, C++, and Wasm.

We begin with the basics, installing and running Node.js, launching a Node HTTP server, presenting in a practical approach the Client-Server model, and implementing a function with Node.js using a TDD approach. The next lessons cover npm projects implementing optimized libraries in C, C++, and torque. The final lessons cover improving the built-in Javascript libraries for V8 for best performance.
